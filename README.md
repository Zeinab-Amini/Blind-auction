In this project, it will first print a logo.
It will ask for your name, and your bid. 
Then it will ask if there are any other bids.
If your type yes, then it will delete your answers and rest all of the questions.
If you say no, it will use a for loop to see if there any other higher bids. 
If not, it will look again until it will find the highest bid and will print the name of the winner and how much they bid for.
